Clocktower
==========

** Strictly beta software. Don't use as your main planning shenaningan cause backwards
compatibility between versions is not guaranteed. ** 

Clocktower is a very early attempt to replace Chequerd. It uses the RedAPI and whatnot. It doesn't 
even have a decent README, but it works. It has collision detection, and a drag & drop GUI to select
courses.

*Currently only Firefox, Chrome and Safari are supported. Opera hasn't been tested. IE suprisingly doesn't work, and won't be officially supported for a while. If you want to work on IE support, I'll accept your PRs with `#respect`.

Trackpad with some good horizontal scrolling highly recommended.
