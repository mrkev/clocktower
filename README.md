Clocktower
==========

Clocktower is a very early attempt to replace Chequerd. It uses the RedAPI and whatnot. It doesn't 
even have a decent README, but it works. It has collision detection, and a drag & drop GUI to select
courses.

*Currently only Firefox, Chrome and Safari (ugh) are supported. I don't test on opera because tbh, who uses it? IE doesn't work (what a suprise) and isn't yet supported. If you want to work on IE support, I'll accept your PRs with #respect.

Trackpad with some good horizontal scrolling highly recommended; the UI is hevily dependent on scrolling. Might add scroll-to-anchor links later.
