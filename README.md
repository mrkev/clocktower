Clocktower
==========

Clocktower is a very early attempt to replace Chequerd. It uses the RedAPI and whatnot. It doesn't 
even have a decent README, but it works. It has collision detection, and a drag & drop GUI to select
courses.

*Currently only Firefox and Chrome are supported. Safari is so slowwww (fix upcoming). Opera IDK, feel
free to let me know. IE doesn't work (what a suprise).

Trackpad with some good horizontal scrolling highly recommended.
