To develop for this project, you should first install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), which includes the Node Package Manager. Running `npm install` will install any necessary packages.

You should also install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

Take care to maintain the existing code style. Make sure to add tests in the `test/tester.js` file for any new features that you add. Make sure to run `grunt test` before submitting.

**Any code that doesn't pass the build will not be accepted.**

Files should all have a newline at the end of them, for consistency.
