        Clocktower is like an old and sick squirrel. Maybe you want to embrace it,
        maybe you shouldn't. Regardless you should use it with utmost caution, 
        not only because it may randomly break down but because there's a huge 
        chance it will die and be and you'll be sad.

        What you should do though it's help it. Post <a href="http://github.com/mrkev/clocktower/issues">issues</a> and fork on <a href="http://github.com/mrkev/clocktower">Github</a>.
